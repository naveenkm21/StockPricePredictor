## Installation

1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Stock-Price-Predictor.git
   cd Stock-Price-Predictor
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment** (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install the required Python libraries**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### 1. Run the Jupyter Notebook

Execute the main notebook `Stock_Price_Predictor.ipynb` to:

- Preprocess the dataset.
- Train ML models.
- Evaluate the model performance.
- Generate predictions.

```bash
jupyter notebook Stock_Price_Predictor.ipynb
```

### 2. Visualize Results in Power BI

- Export the predictions and trends as `.csv` files.
- Use the provided **Power BI Template** (if available) or design custom visuals.

## Model and Techniques

- **Preprocessing**:
  - Missing value handling.
  - Feature engineering (if applicable).
  - Data scaling.

- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - Linear Regression for basic trend analysis.
  - Decision Trees for non-linear patterns.
  - Additional ML or Deep Learning techniques, if applicable.

---

## Dataset

- Include your dataset in the `data/` directory.
- Ensure the dataset contains:
  - **Date**: Time series feature.
  - **Price**: Stock price values.
  - Additional features for enhanced modeling, such as volume or moving averages.

---

## Results

- Evaluate the model's accuracy using metrics like:
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE).
  - R-squared (R²).

- Visualize predictions and actual trends for better insights.
